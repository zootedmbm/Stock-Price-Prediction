# üìà Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** using historical stock data. The project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to forecast future prices based on previous data, using technical analysis indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library:

- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)** stock data from 2010-01-01 to 2021-12-31.
- **Features used**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

## üìä Technologies Used

- **Python üêç**: The main programming language used for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive development and visualization.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used to handle and clean data.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization, used for plotting graphs and charts.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for feature scaling and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Used to build the **LSTM model** for time-series forecasting.
- **TA-Lib / ta**: Libraries for technical analysis indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages.

## ‚úÖ Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- **yfinance**: The dataset is downloaded using the `yfinance` library, which fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- The historical stock data includes the following features: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`.
- The data is cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values and scaling the features using **MinMaxScaler** from Scikit-learn.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Technical Indicators**: The following technical analysis indicators are added to the dataset:
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
  - **Bollinger Bands**: A volatility indicator consisting of a middle band (SMA), upper band, and lower band. The bands widen or contract based on volatility.
  - **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**: A moving average of the stock prices over a specific period. The project uses both short-term and long-term moving averages.
  
- **Normalization**: The data is normalized using the **MinMaxScaler** to scale the features into a range of 0 to 1, making it suitable for the LSTM model.

### 3. Model Building & Training

- **LSTM Model**: The project uses a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, which is well-suited for time-series forecasting problems.
  - The LSTM model takes sequences of previous stock prices and technical indicators to predict future stock prices.
  - The data is split into training and test sets, and the model is trained on the training set.
  
- **Model Training**: The LSTM model is trained on the past stock prices and technical indicators, and the training process is optimized using **Adam** optimizer.

### 4. Prediction

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Once trained, the LSTM model predicts the future stock prices. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices.

### 5. Visualization

- **Actual vs Predicted Stock Prices**: Visualized the comparison between the predicted and actual stock prices to evaluate the performance of the LSTM model.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Plotted the upper and lower Bollinger Bands along with the stock price to show the volatility.
- **RSI**: Visualized the RSI to understand overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Moving Averages**: Plotted the short-term and long-term moving averages on top of the stock prices to observe the trends.

## üìà Model Performance

- **LSTM Model**:
  - **Performance Metric**: The model's performance is evaluated based on prediction accuracy and error metrics.
  - **Predicted vs Actual Stock Prices**: The predicted stock prices from the LSTM model are compared with the actual stock prices. The accuracy and error metrics help assess how well the model performs.
